# Prepering the screen

1. Insert the USB Type-C cable into your printer and the USB A end into your computer. Make sure that the printer is powered on. Windows users should hear a sound indicating that the device has been connected. If you do not hear this sound, try using a different cable until you find one that works.

2. Open PuTTY and select Serial as connection type.

    Serial line: COM3 (if not check your Devicemanager)

    Speed: 1500000

    And press Open
